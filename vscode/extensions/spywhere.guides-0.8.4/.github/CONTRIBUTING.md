### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request.

- Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.
- Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue.

- Version of Guides
- Version of VS Code
- Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) and what you expected versus what you actually saw.
- Images, animations, or a link to a video.
- Errors in the Dev Tools Console (Help | Toggle Developer Tools)

Please remember to do the following:

- Search the issue repository to see if there exists a duplicate.

Don't feel bad if we can't reproduce the issue and ask for more information!
