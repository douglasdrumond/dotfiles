### What is Guides?
Guides is simply an extension that add various indentation guide lines

### How Guides different from built-in indentation guides?
- Stack and Active indentation guides
- Indentation backgrounds

If you just want simple indentation guides, Guides kindly recommended that you use built-in indentation guides instead.

### How it works?
Simply install the extension, Guides should do it job right away (after restart)!

**Note** that all guide lines only show when the text is exceeding the limit due to the extension API limitation.

### Customizations

Please take a look at preferences to see all available options.
Possible values can be access via auto-completion dialog.
The following options might affect how Guides performs...

- `guides.indent.backgrounds`:  
This settings may cause slow performances on multiple indentations.
Each color will be used for each indentation level and will loop around itself.
Value must be in `rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)` format

- `guides.limit.maximum`:  
Set to `-1` for unlimited maximum rendering boundary.  
Set to floating point between `0` and `1` will based the limit from document size.
For example, `0.5` will render guides covered at maximum of 50% in current document.  
Set to `1` or more to render at maximum of specified number of lines.

- `guides.overrideDefault`:  
Set to "true" to suppress any suggestion towards default Visual Studio Code behaviours.

### FAQs

**A:**
- *Normal indentation guide* is a line that run down along each indentation level.
- *Active indentation guide* is a line that run down along the last indentation level of the current line.
- *Stack indentation guide* is a line that run down along each indentation level that comes before the active indentation level.
