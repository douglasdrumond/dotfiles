## 0.6.64 - 5th September, 2017

* [Dan Mace (@ironcladlou)](https://github.com/ironcladlou), [Vincent Chinedu Okonkwo (@codmajik)](https://github.com/codmajik) & [Dima (@hummerd)](https://github.com/hummerd)
    * Support for the `Go To Implementation` command on interfaces. [Feature Request #771](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/771).
* [Craig-Stone (@Craig-Stone)](https://github.com/Craig-Stone)
    * Normalize program path in Windows which otherwise prevented breakpoints from being set correctly when remote debugging. [PR 1131](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1131)
* [Marwan Sulaiman (@marwan-at-work)](https://github.com/marwan-at-work)
    * Refactor the code behind `Go: Browse Packages` to make browsing selected package faster. [PR 1136](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1136)
* [Thomas Darimont (@thomasdarimont)](https://github.com/thomasdarimont)
    * A new snippet called `helloweb` that generates a web app with an http endpoint returning a greeting and current time. [PR 1113](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1113)
* [Nuruddin Ashr (@uudashr)](https://github.com/uudashr)
    * Refactor the way test output is shown to show output of `log.Println`. Fixes [Issue #1120](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1120) with [PR 1124](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1124)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Test Improvements
        * Show test coverage after the command `Go: Test Package` is run. You can disable this by setting `go.coverOnTestPackage` to `false`.
        * Show test coverage even if files are outside of GOPATH. Fixes [Issue #1122](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1122)
        * Decouple running test coverage on save from running build/lint/test on save. Fixes the issue where the problems view was not getting updated until `go.coverOnSave` was disabled.
    * Debugging Improvements
        * No need to set GOPATH in debug configuration in the `launch.json` file anymore. When no GOPATH is provided this way, the debug adapter will now infer the GOPATH based on the path of the file/package being debugged. This fixes [Issue #840](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/840).
        * The debug code lens will now honor the `go.buildFlags`, `go.buildTags` and `go.testFlags` settings. Fixes [Issue #1117](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1117)
        * Fix issue with stepping over standard library code when remote debugging in Windows. Fixes [Issue #1178](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1178)
    * Other Bug Fixes
        * Fix the extra text being selected at the end of formatting run on save. Fixes [Issue #899](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/899) and [Issue #1096](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1096).
        * `gometalinter` and `dlv` will honor the `go.toolsGopath` setting. Fixes [Issue #1110](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1110)
        * Skip vendor folders from lint and vet results. Fixes [Issue #1119](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1119) and [Issue #1121](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/1121)
    

## 0.6.63 - 26th July, 2017

### Features
    
* [Ian Chiles (@fortytw2)](https://github.com/fortytw2)
    * Option to use [megacheck](https://github.com/dominikh/go-tools/tree/master/cmd/megacheck) as a linting tool which 
can have significantly better performance than `gometalinter`, while only supporting a subset of the tools. Use the setting `go.lintTool` to try this.
* [alexandrevez (@alexandrevez)](https://github.com/alexandrevez)
    * Option to highlight gutters rather than full text for code coverage. Use the new setting `go.coverageDecorator` to try this.
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a) & [Marwan Sulaiman (@marwan-at-work)](https://github.com/marwan-at-work)
    * Browse packages and go files with new command `Go: Browse Packages`. [Feature Request 330](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/330)
         - If cursor is on an import statement, then files from the imported package will be shown in the quick pick control
         - Else, all packages are shown in the quick pick control. Select any and corresponding Go files will be shown next.
         - Selecting any of the Go files, will open the file in a new editor.
* [Saud Khan (@bidrohi)](https://github.com/bidrohi)
    * Print import paths of Go tools as they get installed. [PR 1032](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1032)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a) 
    * Prompt to update dependent Go tools when there is a change in the Go version. [Feature Request 797](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/797)
    * Better user experience when dependent Go tools are missing. [Feature Request 998](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/998)
         - Prompts will only show up for tools that are used for features that are explicitly executed by the user. Eg: Rename, Generate Unit Tests, Modify tags. And not for features that get triggered behind the scenes like linting, hover or format on save.
         - When the prompts do show up, closing them will ensure that they wont show up for the duration of the current session of VS Code.

    * `Go: Generate Interface Stubs` should work when interface is prefixed with package path


## 0.6.62 - 9th June, 2017

### Features
* [Jamie Stackhouse (@itsjamie)](https://github.com/itsjamie)
   * New command `Go: Generate interface stub` to generate stubs that implement given interface using [impl](https://github.com/josharian/impl). [PR 939](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/939)
        - When the command is run, you are prompted to provide interface name. Eg: `f *File io.Closer`
        - The stubs are then generated where the cursor is in the editor.
* [Guilherme Oenning (@goenning)](https://github.com/goenning)
    * New setting `go.testEnvFile` to configure the location of a file that would have environment variables to use while running tests. [PR 971](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/971)
        - File contents should be of the form `key=value`.
        - Values from the existing setting `go.test.EnvVars` will override the above
        - These environment variables will also be used by the "Debug Test" codelens
        - When debugging using the debug viewlet or pressing `F5`, the above will not be used. Continue to use the `env` and/or `envFile` property in the debug configurations in the `launch.json` file.
* [Ole (@vapourismo)](https://github.com/vapourismo)
    * You can now run build/lint/vet on the whole workspace instead of just the current package on file save. [PR 1023](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/1023)
        - To enable this, the settings `go.buildOnSave`, `go.lintOnSave` and `go.vetOnSave` now take values `package`, `workspace` or `off` instead of the previous `true`/`false`. 
        - These features are backward compatible and so if you are still using `true`/`false` for these settings, they will work as they did before, but you will get a warning in your settings file.
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Better build performance when working on main packages and test files by using the `-i` flag.
    * Better linting experience while running `gometalinter` by using the `--aggregate` flag which aggregates similar errors from multiple linters.

### Bug Fixes
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)

    * Fix for [Bug 964](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/964) The setting `go.referencesCodeLens.enabled` is deprecated in favor of `go.enableCodeLens` to control multiple types of codelens.
        ```json
        "go.enableCodeLens": {
            "references": false,
            "runtest": true
        }
        ```

### Test Coverage
* [Thomas Bradford (@kode4food)](https://github.com/kode4food)
    * New setting `go.coverageOptions` to control whether you want to highlight only covered code or only uncovered code or both when code coverage is run. [PR 945](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/945)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * The command `Go: Test Coverage In Current Package` is renamed to `Go: Toggle Test Coverage In Current Package` and it does exactly what the name suggests. Toggles test coverage. [Commit cc661daf](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/commit/cc661dafd06770137459b72441e5f7cc877483f0)

    * Fix for [Bug 947](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/947) Mac users using the latest delve from master may see that all env variables are empty while debugging their code. This is due to delve using the `--backend=lldb` option in Mac by default. You can now change this default value by setting the `backend` property to `native` in the `launch.json` file. [Commit 4beecf1](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/commit/4beecf1db2aaa18b336be2ee64476b56202fc959). Root cause is expected to be fixed in delve itself and is being tracked in [derekparker/delve/818](https://github.com/derekparker/delve/issues/818)
* [Tyler Bunnell (@tylerb)](https://github.com/tylerb)
    * Fix for [Bug 943](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/943) Live error reporting now works across multiple files in the current package, mapping errors to the correct files. [PR 923](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/923)

* [Eon S. Jeon (@esjeon)](https://github.com/esjeon)
    * GOPATH from settings is now honored when users debug current file without having a `launch.json` file. [PR 904](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/904)
        * Note: Once you have a `launch.json` file, GOPATH from settings wont be read. You will need to set it in the `env` property as before

* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * `--config` flag for `gometalinter` now supports the use of `${workspaceRoot}` and `~` that allows users to provide config file path relative to workspace or home directory respectively. [PR 909](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/903)
    * New command `Go: Test All Packages in Workspace` to run tests from all packages in the workspace.

## 0.6.57 - 30th March, 2017
Fix for [Bug 892](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/892) which breaks build when the user has multiple GOPATHs and the Go project being worked on is not the first one among the multiple GOPATHs.

### Editing improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Use [gomodifytags](https://github.com/fatih/gomodifytags) to add/remove tags on selected struct fields. [PR 880](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/880)
         * If there is no selection, then the whole struct under the cursor will be selected for the tag modification.
         * `Go: Add Tags` command adds tags configured in `go.addTags` setting to selected struct fields. By default, `json` tags are added. Examples:
             * To add `xml` tags, set `go.addTags` to `{"tags": "xml"}` 
             * To add `xml` with `cdata` option, set `go.addTags` to `{"tags": "xml", "options": "xml=cdata"}`

    * `Go: Install Tools` command now installs `godoc`. [PR 854](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/854)

### Others
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Use `GOPATH` as defined by the `go env` output as default. Use `go` binary from default platform specific locations when GOROOT is not set as env variable. Fixes [Bug 873](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/873)
    * Fix compiling errors for vendor packages in case of symlinks. [PR 864](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/864)

Best used to ignore vendor folders while doing a workspace symbol search. [PR 795](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/795)
    
## 0.6.55 - 3rd March, 2017
* Re-publishing the extension from a non Windows machine as the fix for [Bug 438](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/438) worked only on Windows machines.
For details read the discussion in [PR 838](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/838).

## 0.6.54 - 28th February, 2017

### Tooling improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a) and [Sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-langserver)
    * A new setting `go.useLanguageServer` to use the Go language server from [Sourcegraph](https://github.com/sourcegraph/go-langserver) for features like Hover, Definition, Find All References, Signature Help, Go to Symbol in File and Workspace. [PR 750](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/750)
        * This is an experimental feature and is not available in Windows yet.
        * If set to true, you will be prompted to install the Go language server. Once installed, you will have to reload VS Code window.
        The language server will then be run by the Go extension in the background to provide services needed for the above mentioned features.

### GOPATH improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Fix for [Bug 623](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/623). `${workspaceRoot}` and `~` are now supported in `go.gopath` and `go.toolsGopath` settings. [PR 768](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/768)
    * The default GOPATH used by Go 1.8 when none is set as environment variable is now supported by the extension as well. [PR 820](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/820)
* [Vincent Chinedu Okonkwo (@codmajik)](https://github.com/codmajik)
    * Added new setting `go.inferGopath`. When `true` GOPATH will be inferred from the path of the folder opened in VS Code.
    This will override the value from `go.gopath` setting as well as the GOPATH environment variable. [PR 762](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/762)

### Debugging improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Debug current file without a launch configuration file. Simply press `F5` to start the debug session. 
    A `launch.json` is still required to debug tests or for advanced debug configurations. [PR 769](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/769)
    * Launch configuration snippets are now available for common scenarios like debugging file/package or debugging a test package/function.
    These snippets can be used through IntelliSense when editing the `launch.json` file. [PR 794](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/794)
    * Fix for [Bug 492](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/492). Now when there are build errors, starting a debug session will display the error instead of hanging. [PR 774](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/774)
* [Rob Lourens (@roblourens)](https://github.com/roblourens)
    * Fix for [Bug 438](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/438). Now when you stop a debug session, all processes started by the session will be closed as well. [PR 765](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/765)
* [Suraj Barkale (@surajbarkale-dolby)](https://github.com/surajbarkale-dolby)
    * Fix for [Bug 782](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/782). Helpful error messages when the `program` attribute in `launch.json` file is invalid or not a full path. [PR 790](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/790)
* [F0zi (@f0zi)](https://github.com/f0zi)
    * Fix for [Bug 689](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/689). When debugging against a remote machine, paths anywhere under the GOPATH will be correctly mapped so you can set breakpoints in them. 
    Previously only paths next to the program could be debugged. [PR 742](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/742)

### Testing improvements
* [Oleg Bulatov (@dmage)](https://github.com/dmage)
    * Added new setting `go.testOnSave`. When `true`, all tests in the current package will be run on saving a Go file. 
    The status of the tests will be shown in the status bar at the bottom of the VS Code window. It is not advised to have this on when you have Auto Save enabled. [PR 810](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/810)
* [Jeff Willette (@deltaskelta)](https://github.com/deltaskelta)
    * Test output is no longer verbose by default. Add `-v` to the `go.testFlags` to get verbose output. [PR 817](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/817)
    
### Other Bug Fixes
* [Richard Musiol (@neelance)](https://github.com/neelance)
    * Fix offset for files with multibyte characters so that features like Hover and Go To Definition work as expected. [PR 780](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/780)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Fix for [Bug 777](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/777) Less disruptive experience during test failures when `go.coveronSave` is `true`.
    * Fix for [Bug 680](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/680) Reduce noise in Go to Symbol in File feature by removing the entries corresponding to import statements. [PR 775](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/775)


## 0.6.53 - 30th January, 2017

### Installation improvements
* [Sam Herrmann (@samherrmann)](https://github.com/samherrmann), [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    *  A new setting `go.toolsGopath` for providing an alternate location to install all the Go tools that the extension depends on, if you don't want them cluttering your GOPATH. [PR 351](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/351) and [PR 737](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/737).
        * This is useful when you work on different GOPATHs.
        * Remember to run `Go: Install Tools` command to install the tools to the new location.
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * All the "Install tool" options (the pop ups you see) and the `Go: Install Tools` command now support `gometalinter` if it is your chosen linting tool. [PR 735](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/735).
        * Since `gometalinter` internally installs linters and expects them to be in the user's GOPATH, `gometalinter` will get installed to your GOPATH and not the alternate location specified in `go.toolsGopath`

### Build improvements
* [Matt Aimonetti (@mattetti)](https://github.com/mattetti)
    * While building, we now use the `-i` flag (for non main packages) which installs dependent packages, which in turn get used in subsequent builds resulting in faster builds in bigger workspaces. [PR 718](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/718)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * Build errors with no line numbers (for eg. Import cycle) are now displayed in the output window and will be mapped to the first line of the file. [PR 740](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/740)

### Test improvements
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
    * A new setting `go.testFlags` that can be used to run tests. If null, `go.buildFlags` will be used. [PR 482](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/482)
    * Customize flags for each of the test command by using different keybindings. [PR 482](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/482). In the below example, `ctrl+shift+t` is bound to run the tests in current file with `-short` flag. The commands here can be `go.test.package`, `go.test.file` or `go.test.cursor`.
	
        ```json
        {
            "key": "ctrl+shift+t",
            "command": "go.test.file",
            "args": {
                "flags": ["-short"]
            },
            "when": "editorTextFocus"
        }
        ```
    * New toggle command `Go: Toggle Test File` that lets you toggle between your Go file and the corresponding test file. Previous commands `Go: Open Test File` and `Go: Open Implementation For Test File` have been deprecated in favor of this new command. [PR 739](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/739). You can add a keyboard binding to this as below:
	
        ```json
        {
            "key": "ctrl+shift+t",
            "command": "go.toggle.test.file",
            "when": "editorTextFocus && editorLangId == 'go'"
        }
        ```
    * If current file is not a test file, show error message while running test commands, instead of displaying success message. Fixes [#303](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/issues/303)
* [Marcel Voigt (@nochso)](https://github.com/nochso)
   * Show error message in output window when running test coverage fails. [PR 721](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/721)

### Debugging improvements
* [Andreas Kuhn (@ankon)](https://github.com/ankon)
   * Honor the `cwd` launch configuration argument. [PR 714](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/714)
* [Ramya Rao (@ramya-rao-a)](https://github.com/ramya-rao-a)
   * GOPATH set in the `env` property in `launch.json` will also be used to find `dlv` tool. [PR 725](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/725).
* [Rob Lourens (@roblourens)](https://github.com/roblourens)
   * New property `trace` in `launch.json` to provide option to have verbose logging while debugging using vscode-debug-logger. [PR 753](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/753). This will help in diagnosing issues with debugging in the Go extension.

    * Improve performance by reducing number of calls to `godoc`, `godef`, `gogetdoc`. [PR 711](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/pull/711)
    * Default value for `go.autocompleteUnimportedPackages` is now false to reduce noise in the suggestion list. Members of unimported packages will still show up in suggestion list after typing dot after package name.
