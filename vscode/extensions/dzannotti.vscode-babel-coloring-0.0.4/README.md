# VSCode - Babel

This is a standalone version of the syntax given with [vscode-flowtype](https://github.com/flowtype/flow-for-vscode).

Improves majorly on the grammar distributed by default with vscode.

This language extension brings no changes to the intellisense

## What does it looks like?
![Like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dzannotti/vscode-babel/master/images/screenshot.png "Screenshot")

## Ok I'm sold how do I try it?
You can find it on VSCode Marketplace
shift+cmd+p + install extension -> search for Babel Syntax

## FAQ
### How do I know it's working?
It should display Javascript (Babel) as current mode when you open js files in the status bar

### I installed this, my coloring looks even worse now
This grammar emits specific grammar token types that are not widely supported (but improve on the default ones).
Any theme can color those tokens, however currently the only theme I know that does is [Spacemacs Theme](https://github.com/dzannotti/vscode-theme-spacemacs)

**Enjoy!**
