## Development setup
I welcome any quality bugfixes or contributions!

* Clone this repo
* Run `npm install -g gulp` and `npm install` in '/vscode-chrome-debug'
    * You may see an error if `bufferutil` or `utf-8-validate` fail to build. These native modules required by `ws` are optional and the adapter should work fine without them.
* Run `gulp build`

## Developing in the vscode-chrome-debug-core module
Most of the code is actually in [this repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-chrome-debug-core) which is published in npm as `vscode-chrome-debug-core`. You can clone that repo separately to any directory and use `npm link` to test the extension with a modified version.

## Debugging
In VS Code, run the `launch as server` launch config - it will start the adapter as a server listening on port 4712. In your test app launch.json, include this flag at the top level: `"debugServer": "4712"`. Then you'll be able to debug the adapter in the first instance of VS Code, in its original TypeScript, using sourcemaps.

## Testing
There is a set of mocha tests which can be run with `gulp test` or with the `test` launch config. Also run `gulp tslint` to check your code against our tslint rules.

See the project under testapp/ for a bunch of test scenarios crammed onto one page.

## Naming
* "Client": VS Code
* "Target": The debuggee, which implements the Chrome Debug Protocol
* "Server-mode": In the normal use-case, the extension does not run in server-mode. For debugging, you can run it as a debug server - see the 'Debugging' section above.

## Issue tags
* "Bug": Something that should work is broken
* "Enhancement": AKA feature request - adds new functionality
* "Task": Something that needs to be done that doesn't really fix anything or add major functionality. Tests, engineering, documentation, etc.
